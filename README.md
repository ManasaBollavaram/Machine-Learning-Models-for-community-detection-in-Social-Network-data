# Machine-Learning-Models-for-community-detection-in-Social-Network-data
Implemented Stochastic Block Models (SBM), Exponential Random Graph Models (Ergms) and Hierarchial Exponential Random Graph Models (Hergms) to recover the community structure in Sampson's network dataset using R in RStudio. Hergms and SBMs with local dependency performed 76\% better than Ergms with global dependency.
